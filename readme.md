## Getting Started

You'll need `python3` for this and an internet connection, also make sure to get the email address (of the form `xxxxx@iitb.ac.in`) and password for your yearbook account if you have forgotten it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohankalbag/fetch-my-memories
cd fetch-my-memories
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 generateYearBook.py YOUR_EMAIL_ID YOUR_PASSWORD
```

You can find your yearbook ready as `yearbook.pdf` and a printable version of it as `yearbook_printable.pdf`, ready your printers!

Or you could just use Google Colab
